README - War Card Game

Project Overview
Welcome to the War Card Game project! This project is a digital version of the classic card game "War," with a unique twist where the Ace card loses to 2 but defeats all other cards. The game can be played by 2 or 4 players and is designed to provide an engaging and user-friendly experience.
